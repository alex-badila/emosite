	<h2>Main Characteristics</h2>
	<p>Emo is known as a more sensitive type of punk. Lyrics are usually emotional and often personal or confessional, including such topics as failed romance, self-loating, pain, insecurity, suicidal thoughts, love, and relationships. It uses both softness and loudness in its guitar dynamics.</p>

	<p>Emo started out in the mid-'80s, as a style of post-hardcore, which split off from hardcore punk. By the early-mid '90s, it was adopted and reinvented by alternative rock, indie rock, and pop punk bands. It reached mainstream popularity in the early 2000s, with many artists in the genre being signed to major record labels.</p><br>
