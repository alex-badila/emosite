	<p>Here are some popular emo bands.</p><br>
	<h2>My Chemical Romance</h2>

	<p>This is the quintessential emo band. You can't call yourself an emo listener without it! Started in Newark, New Jersey in 2001, the band split up in 2013. However, they have since reunited in 2019. Yay!</p>
	<h3>Example Song</h3>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRKJiM9Njr8">Welcome to the Black Parade</a>
	<h2>Black Veil Brides</h2>

	<p>A lot less well known than MCR, but this band's music packs quite a punch! They have introduced many elements of metal into their music, making them a lot louder and more angry than the usual emo band.</p>
	<h3>Example Song</h3>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0EQlIzPowM">In The End</a>
	<h2>30 Seconds to Mars</h2>

	<p>Who better to sing out heartfelt lyrics than The Joker himself? Yes, that is Jared Leto as the lead vocalist, and he carries an impressive range, along with a lot of passion!</p>
	<h3>Example Song</h3>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yvGCAvOAfM">The Kill (Bury Me)</a><br>
	<h2>Fall Out Boy</h2>

	<p>Another classic band. It has a more mainstream style, but still has that emotional oomph that good emo delivers!</p>
	<h3>Example Song</h3>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onzL0EM1pKY">Thnks fr th Mmrs</a><br>
	<h2>Jimmy Eat World</h2>

	<p>This band was among the first of this genre to reach mainstream appeal. It also has that one song that everyone knows. Yeah, that one!</p>
	<h3>Example Song</h3>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKsxPW6i3pM">The Middle</a><br><br><br>
